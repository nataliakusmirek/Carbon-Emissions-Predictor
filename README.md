# Carbon Emissions Predictor 

Tensorflow NN Model had a MAE of 0.97

How It Works:
When the user submits a year, the backend will compute the predicted emissions, the error between the prediction and actual emissions (if applicable), and the model evaluation metrics.
The updated predict.html template displays these values and includes a plot showing the emissions comparison for the specified year.
